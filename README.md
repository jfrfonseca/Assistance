# Este trabalho foi desenvolvido por José F. R. Fonseca como parte dos requisitos para graduação em Ciências da Computação pela PUC Minas. O documento PDF na pasta public consiste na monografia produzida a partir do projeto. O vídeo na mesma pasta consiste numa apresentação sobre o mesmo. Espero que Assistance ajude em suas necessidades de HPC doméstica!

# About the project: This academic novelty was develloped by José F. R. Fonseca as a requirement for graduation on Computer Science on PUC Minas, Brazil. Accompaning academic documentation can be found on the folder "public" in portuguese only. A brief description of the project follows:

#### Assistance is a seamless, secure and geek-free Computing Resources Sharing Network. Let your devices, and your friends', unite and share their power!

Imagine that a very light machine, a small, comfortable and light device - a tablet mayhap - could run as fast as a heavyweight computer.
But, without expensive processing devices. Without the battery drain. And never becoming obsolete.
Imagine that this device is a 2010-Ipad some of us still own. No need to buy new tech.


##### Assistance is easy as installing an app from the app store

There are many ways to share computer resources, like processors and memory, with other devices. Projects like SETI@home (setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu) allow  anyone - geek or not - help NASA look for aliens! For real! SETI@home is a software that, once installed, runs in your computer processing data produced by NASA's center of Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence. It helps the scientists spare much needed resources, like money, electricity, and computers. It allows YOUR machine to run THEIR apps.

Other projects, like BOINC (boinc.berkeley.edu) and OurGrid (www.ourgrid.org) let programmers make some computer code, cram it on each other's machines, and process lots of data, fast and energy-efficiently. Recapitulating: those systems let PROGRAMMERS SEND CODE to be run in YOUR machine. Nothing wrong with that, mind me, but it does limits the users of such systems to programmers and tech-savy researchers.


##### Assistance is for the everyday user, by the everyday user

Install the Assistance app, log on to it with some web account (like your Facebook or Gmail), and... that's it! You are already sharing your computer's strength with all your friends (online) that also use Assistance! Wherever you are! Everybody in YOUR contact network can enjoy the power you share with them. Simply and securely.


##### Assistance is secure

This idea must be clear: An Assistance user shares machines with a well-defined community of known peers. No strangest with that party - your machine is only shared with selected, well-known personal contacts.
And, this is vital: NO PERSONAL DATA IS SHARED. YOUR FILES ARE NOT PUBLICALLY ACCESSIBLE. Assistance will protect your information at all costs. It will not allow anyone to tamper with your stuff. Assistance shares computing power, not file storage.

It means that the only risk posed by the system would be to some cracker or black-hat hacker send some malicious software over the system. It will not happen, since users of Assistance DO NOT SEND CODE to each other. They send QUESTS, simple descriptions of the problems they need solved, and the data to solve those.
Most complex programs use lots of common and famous algorithms and pieces of code. When a user downloads Assistance to a machine, some popular code is included. Those are called Assistance Apps. Your peers can only ask you to run one of those apps from them, processing the data they send you.
And it is not at all hard to use, because...


##### Assistance is discrete

Your machine boots up with Assistance. It will automatically detect that some program you are using, like a game or analysis, wants the system to run a certain popular algorithm. Assistance will realize that your computer, that may be a tablet or phone, lacks the computing power necessary to run the algorithm. Also, that your machine has the Assistance App that runs said algorithm.

Assistance will tell your machine to chill out a bit, because it got it covered. Assistance will get the needy algorithm to be run in one of your friends' idle computer, sparing your machine's time and battery.
And no one gets the wiser. Assistance does all that without the need of an input from the user, in a discrete, background process.

Assistance can interact with any Assistance-enabled program. The program may request the system to remotely run any Assistance App. About those apps...


##### Assistance is customizable

You can choose the menu of Assistance Apps that your machine will volunteer to run for your peers. It is as easy as choosing apps to download from the app store. Make your collection, and your friends will be able request your machine to run any of that specific, customized and well-defined set of apps.


##### Assistance is scalable and efficient. And very portable and compatible

Since the Assistance Apps are only commonly called descriptions of problems to be solved, the solution used - the code used - can be highly optimized to the machine that runs them. It means that a tablet can request a app to be run in a desktop computer running Mac, Windows, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and pretty much any operating system, using hardware from Intel, ARM, AMD, Qualcomm, Nvidea, IBM, Cray, or almost any other vendor.

It might even be some other sort of machine, like a enterprise grade mainframe or computer cluster, VMs on a virtualized environment like Amazon Web Services or Google App Engine, or even a videogame console. That old Nintendo GameCube could just become way more useful.

Technically, a Android tablet could request a Assistance App to be run in a friend's Quantum computer. Maybe you've got powerful friends, who knows.


#####  Assistance is free and open source. And always will be

This project is fruit of a childhood dream. One cannot put a price tag on a dream. One will always try to share a dream, with as many people will listen.

This project is fruit of the dream that one day all your tech would talk to each other, and help each other out.
If machines could have friends, what would they talk about? That's a preposterous question. Machines wouldn't just chip-chat. They would try to help each other accomplish its mission. They were made to help. They were made to give Assistance.
